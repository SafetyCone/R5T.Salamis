# R5T.Salamis
A public codenamed NuGet-packaged library containing data-as-code stringly-typed path values.

Library checklist:

. Public.
. No dependencies.
. Not service based. This library is data-as-code, and thus provides functionality via the specific-typing of the example types. One could imagine abstracting this functionality into an interface, but that would probably be overkill.
